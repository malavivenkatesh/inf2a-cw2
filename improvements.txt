The system does not deal well with complex sentences, such as "John and Mary are ducks." One way to improve the system for more comlpex sentences would be to increase the scope of the grammar, however this may create a lot more work for the agreement checking. This could be done with a small change to the current system by extending the grammar slightly so it allowed phrases such as "John is a purple duck." and would store all the information, rather than only storing the input "John is a duck."
Another improvement to the system would be storing facts using logical expressions that were more expressive than than unary and binary  predicates. This might allow for use of transitive statements such as "All ducks fly." and "John is a duck." to immediately answer the question "Who flies?". This might be a more difficult implementation.
